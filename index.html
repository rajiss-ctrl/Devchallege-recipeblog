    <td> <strong>Make the crust:</strong>Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs.Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
       and melted butter until combined.(You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly  into the bottomand slightly up the sides
       of a 9-inche or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use a bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down  tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes.
       Remove from the oven  and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminium foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool
       as you prpare the feelings.</td>

         together on medium-highs speed in a large bowl until the mixture  is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla exract, and lemon juice
         then beat util fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after reach addition until just blended. After the final egg is
         incorporated into the batter, stop mixing . To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating  and cracking as it cools, aviod over-mixing the batter as best as you can.</td>

    <td><strong>Preparing the simple water  bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water  i your roastin pan for the water bath,
      so make sure you boil enough. I use entire kettle  of hot water.
    As the water is heating up, wrp the aluminium foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.
  Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.
Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan  and place in the oven.
( Or you can place the roasting pan  in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you. ) </td>

<td>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center  is almost set. when it's done, the center of the cheesecake

    in the water bath as it cools down  for 1 hour. Removefrom the oven  and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temprature.
  Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</td>
